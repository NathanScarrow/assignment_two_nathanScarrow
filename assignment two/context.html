        <h2>Online Echo Chambers</h2>
        <p>Social media allows users to form and engage with like-minded communities 
            and groups, reinforcing their existing beliefs and values. In other words, it categorizes them
            into similar groups. The result of this, is the creation of online echo chambers.
             These echo chambers can lead to the reinforcement of hyperindividualism, as individuals are less 
             likely to engage with opposing viewpoints or participate in constructive dialogue.

        <h2>This Year in Reflection</h2>
        <p>The internet has become a breeding ground for disinformation and misinformation, 
            making it challenging for individuals to discern credible sources from unreliable 
            ones, which has seriously impacted our ability to think critically. When combined
            with the increase in social media echochambers, it is easy to see how hyperindividualism
            has become more common in our society. 
            </p>
            <p>I think it is important that we all take some time to really reflect on what 
                is important to us. Is it really worth arguing online for hours on end, over things
                that have little to no impact on the day to day lives of people? Do we really 
                want to base our entire personality on a political ideaology or societal issue? 
            </p>
            <p>We should all take a step back, relax, and focus more on being open-mided, and open
                to collarboration. Don't get stuck in the echo chambers, and stuck in your own ideas or 
                beliefs.
