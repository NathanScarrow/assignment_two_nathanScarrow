        <h2>What is "Hyperindividualism"?</h2>
        <p>In short, hyperindividualism is a phenomenon where people view themselves and their ideas as overly important. They believe their beliefs are shared by everyone.
            Social media usage has led to widespread hyper individualism, which has
            destroyed our ability to think critically about key issues in our society. Media platforms such as
            Twitter (now “X”), Instagram/Facebook, and TikTok have placed people into echo chambers
            where their ideas and beliefs are constantly reinforced, to the point where the opposition of those
            beliefs is incomprehensible and viewed as a direct attack on a persons character.</p>

        <h2>How Has Social Media Impacted This?</h2>
        <p>If you do a quick scroll online, you will likely notice that people have become
           hyper opinionated on topics such as poitics and societal issues due to thier online activity. People segment
            themselves online with likeminded people. This further drives home the idea of the online "echo-chambers". </p>
        <p>Social media platforms use algorithms to tailor content to individual users, showing them posts, news, 
            and advertisements based on their preferences and past interactions. This is what creates echo-chambers, where 
            people are exposed primarily to information that aligns with their existing beliefs and interests, 
            reinforcing their preconceived notions and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.</p>
